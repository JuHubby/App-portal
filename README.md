# ATM-Portal

## Description of the project:
This repository demonstrates the implementation of a banking portal application, facilitating simple actions such as depositing and withdrawing funds from a bank account, with some validations where the withdraal can exceed the balance of the account. Thhis app is created by using react-bootstrap libraries. togetehr with the validation it was added some alert messages that pop up in the screeen whn the user reaches o$0- in their balance.

## How to Run:
This project was initialized using the Create React App toolchain. If you're interested in learning how to start your own app from a toolchain, follow the steps from the section "Mastering React: A Step-by-Step Guide to Creating Your App with Toolchain Assistance" . Otherwise, simply fork this project and then clone it to your local machine. To visualize this app in the browser, navigate to your terminal, stand in the cloned file directory, and type 'npm start.' This will take you to your browser, allowing you to enjoy this cool application.


## Roadmap of future improvements:
There are numerous improvements and additions that can be implemented in this code. My goal is to introduce extra features to enhance interactivity of this bank protal, including the integration of Bootstrap React for morevstyling. Additionally, I plan to implement more specific validations, such as verifying the existence of the email.

### Mastering React: A Step-by-Step Guide to Creating Your App with Toolchain Assistance:

Use the VS Code terminal with Git Bash after creating the directory and files for your React application (using toolchains), follow these steps. Ensure that, after creating the folder, you upload the Formik library and use NPM start to initialize your React app (note: you must be located in the directory of your new app). Also, there's no need to concern yourself with the multitude of folders and files that the React app creation process will download into your app directory. If you're a beginner, like myself, the only files you'll need to use are the `index.html` from the public folder and the `app.js` from the src folderâ€”that's it. 


#### 1.Step into the directory where you want your app to be located:
cd name-of-app

#### 2. Create a React app:
npx create-react-app name-of-app

#### 3. Install Formik:
npm install formik --save

#### 4.Start the React app:
npm start

Make sure to follow these steps in sequence, and remember to be in the directory of your new app when performing these actions. For more info go to the:[React Webpage](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started/)
